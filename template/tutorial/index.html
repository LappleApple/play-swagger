    <h2>Welcome to Play-Swagger</h2>

    <p>
        <em>Congratulations, youâ€™ve just created a new Play-Swagger application!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/zalando/play-swagger/">Play-Swagger</a> plugin make it easy to build restful web services from a Swagger API specification as the single source of truth. Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture. Built on <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a>, Play provides predictable and minimal resource consumption for highly-scalable applications.  The Play-Swagger plugin takes Swagger API definitions and treats them as the single source of truth of your rest services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Play-Swagger supports round-trip regeneration and compilation of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Play routes definitions (unmanaged).</li>
        <li>Swagger domain model definitions and parameters onto Scala case classes (unmanaged).</li>
        <li>Swagger domain model constraints onto Play validations (unmanaged).</li>
        <li>Generators for random test data generation of parameter values (unmanaged).</li>
        <li>Unit tests for validating the service at API boundary (unmanaged).</li>
        <li>Swagger path definitions onto skeletons for Play controller implementations (managed). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Unmannaged in the list above means that the code does not need to be managed by you, the programmer of the rest service. The plugin takes your swagger API definition as the single source of truth and will regenerate the code in a consistent manner.  You'll instead be focusing on implementing the services' business logic in a managed Play controller class which is generated once, or regenerated if it can not be found.
    </p>

    <h2>Run Your Application</h2>

    <p>
        Before we go any further, let's run the application.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> page.</li>
        <li>Click <em>Run</em> to start the application (if needed).</li>
        <li>View the running application at <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a>.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Actions, Controllers and Results</h2>

    <p>
        In Play, web requests are handled by <code>Action</code>s.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Action</code>s process each request, perform any work that's needed, and then return a <code>Result</code>. <code>Action</code>s are generated by <code>Controller</code>s.
    </p>
    <p>
        This application defines a <code>Controller</code> in <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">app/controllers/Application.scala</a>. <code>Application</code>'s <code>index</code> method creates an <code>Action</code> which returns a <code>Result</code> of <code>Ok</code>.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>HTTP Routing</h2>

    <p>
        Play routes incoming HTTP requests to their <code>Action</code>s. The mappings between requests and <code>Action</code>s are defined in <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">conf/routes</a>.

<div>
    <h2>Twirl Templates</h2>

    <p>
        This application renders HTML using Twirl templates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The templates are defined in the <a href="#code/app/views" class="shortcut">app/views</a> directory. Each Twirl template is compiled into a Scala object which can be called from Java or Scala code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>views.html.index(...)</code> code within <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application.scala</a> calls the <a href="#code/app/views" class="shortcut">app/views/index.scala.html</a> template.
    </p>
    <p>
        Twirl ships with Play by default but you can use other view technologies too. For example, you could use Handlebars instead of Twirl.

<div>
    <h2>Static Assets</h2>

    <p>
        Your application automatically serves static resources such as JavaScript, CSS and images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Normal assets live in the <a href="#code/public" class="shortcut">public</a> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assets that need compilation, such as <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> files, go in the <a href="#code/app/assets" class="shortcut">app/assets</a> folder. These assets have extra processing applied to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assets are served by Play's <code>Assets</code> controller. The <code>Assets</code> controller is configured in the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">conf/routes</a> file.

<div>
    <h2>Build System</h2>

    <p>
        Your Play application is built with <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Build configuration is defined in the <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> file. You can edit this file to add new project dependencies or to change compilation settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plugins extend sbt with new behavior. You can set up sbt plugins in the <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt" class="shortcut">project/plugins.sbt</a> file. The Play sbt plugin is configured in this file. There are also separate plugins to compile assets, such as CoffeeScript and LESS.
    </p>

    <p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Runtime Configuration</h2>

    <p>
        You can change your application's runtime behavior by editing <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">conf/application.conf</a> file. There are lots of commented-out settings in there for you to use as a starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Play uses the <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config#readme" target="_blank">Typesafe Config Library</a> to manage its configuration. Editing the <code>application.conf</code> file is just one of many ways that you can configure your application.

    <h2>Command Line</h2>

    <p>
        You're probably reading this tutorial right now from within <a href="https://typesafe.com/activator">Typesafe Activator</a>'s browser UI. However, if you prefer, you can build and run your application from the command line.
    </p>
    <pre>$ activator ~run</pre>
    <p>
        You can run tests from the command line too.
    </p>
    <pre>$ activator ~test</pre>
